# SplineFunctions
Functions that help to smooth trajectories for robotic systems
Linear spline - Interpolation (trapezoidal control)
Cubic spline - Cubic functions or s-curve (nice trajectory but more expensive)
MATLAB and C codes are provided
Work developed at the Biomechatronics group at MIT Media lab
