# SplineFunctions

Functions that help to smooth trajectories for robotic systems

Linear spline - Interpolation (trapezoidal control)

Cubic spline - Cubic functions or s-curve (nice trajectory but more computation)

MATLAB and C codes are provided

Work developed at the Biomechatronics group at MIT Media lab
